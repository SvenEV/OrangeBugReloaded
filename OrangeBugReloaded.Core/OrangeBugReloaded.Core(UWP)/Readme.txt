This project is meant to be used as a replacement for "OrangeBugReloaded.Core"
when compiling a Universal Windows App using .NET Core.

It maps calls to the TaskEx-class of AsyncBridge (async/await backport) to the Task-class.
It provides a slightly different version of the Reflector-class.
It references the original Newtonsoft.Json package instead of the Unity version.
